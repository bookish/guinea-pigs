# guinea-pigs
Guinea pigs make great pets.
They need a cage, a hut, hay, pellets, and water.  They need to be let out of their cage each day for a few hours to run around.  
They love fresh leafy vegetables.  
They eat a lot of different types of fruits.
Guinea pigs love cuddles in soft towels and blankets.
